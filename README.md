# threejs-cameras

This is a case study on mkaing a three.js package that cam support a camera that renders to a render target, which is able to change locations and angles with the 1-9 keys. 

The goal is to implement this into Webaverse and hyperfy, and other web platforms, as an open sourced interoperable camera tool for documentation of virtual spaces, and real time virtual production.
